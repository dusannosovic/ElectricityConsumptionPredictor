5.  Licensing
-------------------------------------------------------
CenterSpace.NMath is distributed as a free, fully-functional
trial version for a 30-day evaluation period. For continued
use, please purchase a license through our secure online
store.

http://www.centerspace.net/order

CenterSpace.NMath is licensed per developer seat. Each
developer writing code using CenterSpace.NMath requires
a license. (For example, if 5 developers are writing an
application, and only 3 are doing most of the intense math
work, all 5 must have a license.) There are no runtime or
deployment fees for products developed that make use of
CenterSpace packages. The complete CenterSpace.NMath
license agreement is available here.

http://www.centerspace.net/license-agreement

CenterSpace.NMath license information is stored in a
license key which must be found at runtime. The license
key governs the properties of your installation. If no
license key is found, a default evaluation license key
is used which provides a free 30-day evaluation period
for CenterSpace.NMath on the current machine.

You can specify your license key using various mechanisms: 
by environment variable, by configuration app
setting, and programmatically. See here for more information:
